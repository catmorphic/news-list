## New List

A home work I did for an interview in January. Try it [here](https://leihuang23.github.io/news-list/)

### Requirements:

1.  Render a very very long list of news.
2.  Support pagination.
3.  Support searching based on tags.
4.  Lazy-load images.
5.  Auto-completion on search input.
6.  Take care of performance, especially when processing and indexing the news list.
